# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Got stuck on the checkbox portion of my checkpoint this week for a few hours. I had ${this.completed ? "checked" : ' '} for the checkbox but I had a stray " right after the ending bracket so my template wouldn't ever save the checkbox. Other than that everything was fairly simple to get implemented.
