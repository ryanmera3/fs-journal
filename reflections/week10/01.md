## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value = Holds data within it's own memory space.
Reference = Stores the address where the value is being held.
Pointer = Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. There are a lot more value types for ints.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

The memory address location is stored in memory instead of the value at that address.
