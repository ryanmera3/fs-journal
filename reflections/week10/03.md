## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Rows contain data objects. Columns contain figures / names for the rows.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age int NOT NUL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DELETE FROM removes only the rows. DROP TABLE deletes the whole table.
