## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

An object that holds variables in a specific order.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

Find, add, remove. Add and remove seem obvious because you'll most likely continue to edit your lists. Find may be used fairly often if you need to look for a specific value in your list.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

If you want to find one / the first occurence in a list use find. If you want to find everything that matches the find use findall.
