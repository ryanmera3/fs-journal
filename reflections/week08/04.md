## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing - Provides developers with confidence in their code
Component Testing - Confidence that a specific component is functioning correctly
End-To-End (E2E) Testing - Confidence that the application is functioning properly

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Unit testing - For the capstone i've mostly been working on the backend and after every function we wrote we would use postman to test to verify that the functions were working as expected.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I don't really think there is a "least useful" testing method. Each method has it's uses and during the capstone we've used all of them.
