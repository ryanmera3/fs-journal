## Questions

Shows potential employers what skills you have and proves that you have the skills your resume says you have.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

A portfolio that has projects that show off your skillset.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I think the tower and inspire checkpoints are my two personal favorites and I am definitely going to add the capstone to my portfolio. I think those 2 checkpoints went the best when I was making them.
