# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Early in the week everything was easy. Some of the array methods I don't still fully get so I just end up using a for loop. Thursdays afternoon challenge went well, we almost had it working how wanted but we had one function that handled all the HTML drawing and it started to get out of control.
