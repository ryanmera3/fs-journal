## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Helps with debugging amongst other things. If you're expecting console.log to push 5 and it's undefined you can track down what's wrong with your code.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

Elements. You can edit css and html directly into the elements tab and see if it fixes an issue you have.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Add "debugger" to your Javascript
