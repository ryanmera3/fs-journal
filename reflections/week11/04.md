## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I've enjoyed the course overall. I think I have enjoyed learning c# the most but on the backend I still prefer Node since we have had more time to get used to that. My concerns for the Final are styling and making the Front-end look nice.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Gauntlet lecture today was a nice reminder of how to do a few things on the back / front-end before we get the Final tomorrow.
