## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows you to describe a relationship between two classes

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

It depends on the member's access modifiers. All members of a base class are inherited by derived classes but their visibility depends on their access modifiers.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Private members aren't visible from child classes, internal are visible in derived classes, protected are visible only in child classes, public are visible to everything.
