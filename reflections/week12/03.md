# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

Feeling a little better but still sick. I started the front-end today and got about 90% of it build out over the course of the day going to have it graded for the first time tomorrow.
