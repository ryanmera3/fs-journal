# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

I feel just as sick as yesterday and just like yesterday I didn't touch the front-end. Back-end is done besides 1 bug with Keeps.
