# Final Reflection
The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

The week was brutal since I was sick all week. I strugged to get working on the front-end since I wasn't feeling well but was able to meet all the requirements but the UI requirements for the final. I would say being able to get the Final finished while also being sick was a victory.
