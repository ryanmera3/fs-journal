## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Time management technique where you have a fixed amount of time and when you hit that time you stop doing that task

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

strategic quitting - focus on the more important tasks and don't waste energy on the rest

golden hour - I'm most productive from 1-4 PM so focusing on those hours when working tends to help me get the most done

Timeboxing is a habit - Haven't ever tried timeboxing so if I implement it I may be able to get more done

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

When trying to learn programming initially. I would hit walls where I didn't understand something on my own and if I employed timeboxing I may have gotten further into other concepts instead of being stuck on something for hours.
