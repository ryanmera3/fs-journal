## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I think we had decent UX for the partner project but other than that we didn't really add any comments to our code and we were just focused on hitting all the requirements

2. What went well this week?

The backend was easy and we didn't have any issues with that. Ran into a couple roadblocks on the frontend stuff but we got through those as well.

3. What would you do differently?

I would have tried to use less componenets. We ended up with 17 and it became a lot to keep track of what went here.
